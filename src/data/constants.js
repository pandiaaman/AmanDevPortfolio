      "Explores the use of the Top-Down approach in the process of architecting web applications. The project develops on the basic understanding of various features of the application, starting from requirement gathering, such as functional and non-functional requirements, to finally selecting the ASRs (Architecturally Significant Requirements). Discusses the many tactics available to apply the discussed ASRs to the application. Draws the value by developing a C&C diagram(Component and Connector), Sequence Diagram, and a Use-Case Diagram, to understand the various architectural patterns that can be used to solve the challenges. ",

      "This project helped me understand the flow of decision-making steps that need to be undertaken during the designing and architecting of a web application. The use of various tactics such as client-end and server-end caching, along with horizontal and vertical scaling options, helped me understand the value of understanding the user needs and the needs of the project and their role in decision-making as an architect. I also understood that combinations of architectural patterns are necessary to solve a problem as no single pattern is a “one-size-fits-all” solution.",

    about:
      "The project “GOT family tree”, started as a fun side project to explore my interest in the famous TV series, Games Of Thrones. The project was about building a full-stack app using Spring Boot, React, and JavaScript and exploring a React library called React-D3-Tree, used for developing tree-like structures with React components. The project also explores a JSON data file with all the GOT series characters and their various features in the dataset ",

    description:
      "As the number of cars is increasing it is leading to a number of problems such as the area is becoming more congested leading to the immense traffic on road and even lesser space for parking the vehicles. Hence emerges the main problem which includes finding space for parking or manoeuvring the car in the parking space which becomes very difficult because of the congestion. The Parking alert system will make sure that no other vehicle comes and parks in vicinity to the car in a way that it becomes difficult for the driver to get in the car or it gets difficult for the driver to manoeuvre the vehicle later out of the parking space. We aim to create the system that turns on as the vehicles gets parked and alerts the driver of the other vehicle to park at a distance in order to give the vehicle passage for manoeuvring. In the system a microcontroller will be installed along with four ultrasonic sensors on all four sides of the vehicle and an alarm that acts as an actuator. The system actuates only when a certain condition arises which are coded according to the algorithm used in the microcontroller. ",

    description:
      "Development, promotion and application of renewable energy resources has certainly become the need of the hour. With exponential increment in demand and usage of non-renewable energy resources, we all are aware that the time isn’t very far for complete extinction of these resources, leaving us vulnerable. Nations competing with each other for socio economic development are highly dependent on their energy resources and the source of this energy. Over the past few decades, inclination towards the renewable resources has been continuous, giving scope to a much cleaner source of energy, be it due to global warming or depletion of fossil fuels. This paper concentrates on studying the provision of reliable electric system using solar-wind hybrid power systems that harnesses the renewable energy in sun and wind to generate electricity, taking into account maximum power point tracking. Hybrid nature of the system brings redundancy with it, increasing reliability and reducing the dependency on the single source. Measurement and analysis of the preferred site has been done in order to check availability of the resources. Since the capacity factor of the power systems running on renewable resources is more of a question of availability of wind or sun, as they are random in speed, direction and time, and are mostly affected by weather, hence combining both as a hybrid, to harness power can be much more reliable and realistic power source.",
